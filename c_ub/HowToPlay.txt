** The Destroyer **

This is the most important function in this program, as it 
basically destroy an entire city.
The Destroyer accepts by standard two lists (City and Region) that
read from two .dat files the input and are already implemented for you. 
All you have to do is to add the id of the city you want to destroy
and 'The Destroyer' does everything else for you. 

** Aftermath **

After destroying a city, the population of the destroyed city 
will flee to the neighbour cities. Depending on the neighbor cities
population size, each city gets the double amount of people from
the destroyed city.

** Well, which ID is which city? **

Good question. Here is a list for stadt.dat with the ID for each city.
